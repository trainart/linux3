## ACL (Access Control Lists) 

Linux filesystem permissions are today more than we might generally know.

Basically we know permissions for:
* **U**ser (or user owner)
* **G**roup (or owner group)
* **O**ther (everyone else)

which are:
* **R**ead 
* **W**rite 
* e**X**ecute 

Plus three other attributes SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit.

However modern Linux systems have possibility to use additional **ACL**s (**Access Control Lists**), 
which enable more flexible and granular control over access rights.

ACLs enable to set **additional** permissions for file/directory to individual users or groups
without changing the base ownership and permissions.

ACL is Linux kernel feature and is currently supported by many modern filesystems, including (but not limited to):
* **ext2**, **ext3**, **ext4** 
* **xfs**
* **tmpfs**
* **zfs**
* <br>
...


### Install ACL & check it is working/enabled

With ACL (Access Control Lists) it's possible to set access permission to files or directories more strictly than standard permissions.

In recent Linux versions acl package is already installed, but in case of need it can be installed with:

`yum -y install acl`

or

`apt -y install acl`

In order to use ACL, it should be enabled as a mount option for that mounted filesystem/partition. 
Most probably it is already enabled by default. 

For ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems you can check if ACL is enabled as follows:
(in case device name is different use `df -hT` or `lsblk` to find exact name)

`tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep "Default mount options"`

If **acl** is present in default mount options then you can start using it.

For other system it might not be so easy to see if ACL is enabled.
But many of the filesystems listed above always have ACL available, regardless of the mount options.

So it is easier just to check by trying to use it. 
If it works, then it is enabled !


### Simple example

Create test directory 
```bash
mkdir /opt/acltest
```

Check initial state

```bash
getfacl /opt/acltest
```

Nothing special yet.


Now assign acl to `student`
```bash
setfacl -m u:student:rwx /opt/acltest
```

Check now

```bash
getfacl /opt/acltest

```

Now switch to user **student** (`su - student`) 
and try creating something inside that dir.
(you should notice additional "**+**" sign after permissions)

```bash
mkdir /opt/acltest/mydir ;\
ls -la /opt ;\
ls -la /opt/acltest

```


```bash
touch /opt/acltest/myfile ;\
ls -la /opt/acltest 

```


#### PRACTICE

* As `root` create directory `/srv/tryacl`
* Create new user `acluser`
* With ACL rules allow user `acluser` to have `rwx` permissions in `/srv/tryacl` directory
* Become user `acluser` (`su - acluser`)
* Create empty file `/srv/tryacl/MYFILE`
* Create subdirectory `/srv/tryacl/MYDIR`
* Create file `/srv/tryacl/MYDIR/MYFILE2` with text "testing ACL" inside.
* Install `tree` command with `yum -y install tree` 
* Check what you created `tree -fpug /srv/tryacl`


### More advanced examples - Prepare test environment 

As `root` create a set of directories and files:

(there may be need to install `tree` command with `yum -y install tree`)

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/project{1/dir{3,5},2/dir{4,6}} ;\
sudo touch /opt/project{1/file{7,9},2/file8} ;\
tree -fpug /opt/project*

```

### List current ACL with `getfacl`

Check initial ACL list

```bash
getfacl /opt/project*/* | less
```

As we can see no special permissions exist initially


### Create additional ACL with `setfacl`

Try modifying some file <br> 
**as user `student`**

You should not be able to do so.

```bash
echo "Test" > /opt/project1/file7
```

```bash
setfacl -m u:student:w /opt/project1/file7 ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```

Notice added line `user:student:-w-`

Also notice we can see additional ACL are present with `ls -l` too:

```bash
ll /opt/project1/file7
```

NOTE: **[+] is added on attribute**

Now try again  <br> 
**as user `student`**, <br>
it should work now:

```bash
echo "Test1" > /opt/project1/file7 ;\
echo "Test2" >> /opt/project1/file7 ;\

```

But this will not work for other file:

```bash
echo "Test" > /opt/project1/file9
```

<br><br>

At the same time if you try to **see/read** that file it will not work

```bash
cat /opt/project1/file7
```

Why ?

From the above `getfacl` output you may notice:

> `user:student:-w-` <br>
> ... <br>
> `other::r--`

We see that even though all others have **r**, student is specifically mentioned and has only `w`.
Thus student permissions should be mentioned separately.

Let's fix that.

We can remove all ACLs
```bash
setfacl -b /opt/project1/file7
```

And set new ones <br> (NOTE ! Previous removing was not necessary for this, just used to learn `-b' option)

```bash
setfacl -m u:student:rw /opt/project1/file7 ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```

Now try again to **read** that file <br> 
**as user `student`**, <br>
it should work now:

```bash
cat /opt/project1/file7
```

### Remove ACL

Let's new users and add ACLs for them to `/opt/project1/file7`

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ; do useradd user$i ; echo -n "Created user$i. "; setfacl -m u:user$i:rw /opt/project1/file7 ; echo "Set ACL for user$i" ; done ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```
You should see ACL for both `student` and `user1`, `user2`, `user3` ... `user9`

Now let's remove ACL for some of them and remove that users.

```bash
for i in 4 5 6 7 8 9 ; do setfacl -x u:user$i /opt/project1/file7 ; echo -n "Removed ACL for user$i. "; userdel -r user$i ; echo  "Deleted user$i";  done ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```
You should see only ACLs for `student` and `user1`, `user2`, `user3`


#### TASK
Remove remaining ACLs for `user1`, `user2`, `user3`
And remove users `user1`, `user2`, `user3`
(HINT! you may modify above `for` loop)



### Mask

You may notice `mask` option in output of `getfacl`, what is it for?
(don't mix with `umask`, which is totally different thing).

Mask acts as additional/final global permission filter,
ensuring that users or groups **are not granted more permissions than allowed by the mask**.

So for all ACLs **MAXIMUM** of real/effective permissions will be what is allowed by mask
(NOTE! we talk about ACLs, **mask** is not related to basic **rwx** permissions for owner/group/others).

In case we don't specify the mask specifically it will be flexible to allow everything we specified for our ACLs.
But if we will specify that, access will be **not more than** allowed by mask.

If we will run 

```bash
getfacl /opt/project1/file7
```

we will see `mask::rw-`

But let's limit it manually

```bash
setfacl -m m::r /opt/project1/file7 ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```

> NOTICE  what added at the end of the line <br>
> `user:student:rw-		**#effective:r--**` <br>
> it means that real permissions of student are now only `r`

Let's check if it is so.
As user **student** run the following:

```bash
echo "Test3" >> /opt/project1/file7 ;\

```

You should get `Permission denied`.

Now let's fix the mask:

```bash
setfacl -m m::rw /opt/project1/file7 ;\
getfacl /opt/project1/file7

```

And try again as user **student** run the following:

```bash
echo "Test3" >> /opt/project1/file7 ;\

```


### ACLs for directories

Set ACL to a directory recursively (**-R**).

> NOTICE we work with second directory `/opt/project2`

```bash
setfacl -R -m u:student:rwx /opt/project2 ;\
getfacl /opt/project2

```

And now try as user **student** run the following:

```bash
mkdir /opt/project2/dirNEW ;\
echo "TEST NEW" > /opt/project2/fileNEW
```

Check

```bash
tree -fpug /opt/project2
```

As we learned there is much more that basic `rwx` permissions in modern Linuxes !
