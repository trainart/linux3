## NTP (Network Time Protocol), NTP Server
_(partially based on https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_8&p=ntp&f=1)_

### Time configuration

There are three main command line tools that can be used to configure and display information about the system date and time:

* `date` traditional command.
* `hwclock` utility for accessing the hardware clock.
* `timedatectl` utility, which is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is part of `systemd`.

Set proper timezone
```bash
timedatectl list-timezones | grep Yerevan
```

```bash
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Yerevan
```

`Chrony` is one of the implementations of the **Network Time Protocol** (`NTP`). 
There is classic solution - `ntpd`, but `Chrony` synchronizes the system clock faster and with better accuracy than `ntpd`.


### Install Chrony 

Install Chrony

```bash
yum -y install chrony
```

It will initially be ready do Time Synchronization, but we can change configuration a little.



### Configure Chrony as NTP Client

Modify following line to `/etc/chrony.conf`
```bash
pool am.pool.ntp.org iburst
```

Uncomment or add:
```bash
log measurements statistics tracking
```


Start Chrony
```bash
systemctl enable --now chronyd
```


Check
```bash
tail -f /var/log/chrony/tracking.log
```


Your should see Chrony is working via IP addresses of `am.pool.ntp.org`.


### Configure Chrony as NTP Server

To enable Chrony act as Server enable following line to `/etc/chrony.conf`
```bash
allow 10.10.0.0/16
```

Restart Chrony
```bash
systemctl restart chronyd
```


Teacher can now configure his Chrony as NTP Server 
and Students can configure their Chrony ot use that NTP Server

When ready use some command like below to set wrong time 
and then wait Chrony to fix the date/time.

```bash
date 0101000000
```
